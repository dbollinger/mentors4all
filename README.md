This project is deployed using [surge](https://surge.sh/).
It's pretty magical, but it seems to get the job done.
Check it out at http://mentors4all.surge.sh/

Note, this is the compiled version of the Ember app with the integrity checks removed and the crossdomain.xml deleted.

### How do I do it myself?
```bash
$ npm install -g surge
$ surge
```
